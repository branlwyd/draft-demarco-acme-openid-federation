--- abstract


The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) is the standard [RFC8555] that allows obtaining certificates for websites (HTTPS [RFC2818]) by verifing the "fully-qualified" domain names [RFC3696] and the web servers within these.

OpenID Connect Federation 1.0 [OIDC-FED] is the standard that allows building multilateral federations through a trust evaluation mechanism attesting the possession of public keys, signature capabilities, protocol specific metadata and several administrative and tecnical information in the form of trust marks, related to a specific entity belonging to an organization.

This document defines how the X.509 certificates can be issued by a trust anchor and its intermediates through the ACME protocol to all the organizations that are part of a federation built on top of OpenID Connect Federation 1.0.

# Introduction

OpenID Connect Federation 1.0 allows an ACME server to issue X.509 certificates to one or more than a single organization without having pre-established any direct relationship or any stipulation of a contract.

In a multilateral federation, composed by thousands of entities belonging to different organizations, all the participants adhere to the same regulation or trust framework. OpenID Connect Federation 1.0 allows each participant to recognize the other participant using a trust evaluation mechanism, with RESTful services and cryptographic materials.

Considering that a requestor is an entity requesting the issuance of a X.509 certificate to a server and the issuer is the ACME server that validates the entitlements of the requestor before issuing the X.509 certificate, this specification defines how ACME and OpenID Connect Federation 1.0 can be integrated allowing an efficient issuance of X.509 to a requestor, reducing both the bureaucratic and the implementative costs, since:

- It reduces the number of resources required by the ACME server, since the authentication and authorization of the requestor is asserted with OpenID Connect Federation 1.0.
- It defines how to use and validate a basic OpenID Connect Federation component, called Entity Configuration, that is a signed JWT published in a well-known resource (`/.well-known/openid-federation`) without requiring the `/.well-known/acme-challenge/{token}` endpoint.
- It removes the requirement for the authentication of an entity and the provisioning of the *acme-challenge token*, since the authorization mechanisms is built on top of the trust evaluation model as defined in OpenID Connect Federation 1.0.
- It extends the ACME `newOrder` resource, defining a new payload identifier type called `openid-federation`.
- It defines how the OpenID Federation Entity Statements can be used for the publication of the X.509 certificates, by a trust anchor or intermediate, that was previously issued with ACME.

# Audience Target and Use Cases

The audience of the document are the multilateral federations that require automatic issuance of X.509 certificates using an infrastructure of trust based on OpenID Connect Federation 1.0.

This specification can be implemented by:

- Federation Entities that joins to a federation staging area using HTTP only transport to attests themselves as trustworhty, and then ask X.509 certificates for their official HTTPs Federation Entity ID.
- Federation Entities that want to ask and obtain X.509 certificate for every Federation Key contained in their Entity Configuration, as made recognizable in a Federation Trust Chain.


# Terminology

   **ACME**,    Automated Certificate Management Environment, a certificate management protocol [RFC8555].

   **TA**,      OpenID Connect Federation Trust Anchor, see CA

   **CA**,      Certification Authority, also known as Trust Anchor or Intermediate, specifically one that implements the ACME protocol by serving an ACME server.

   **CSR**,     Certificate Signing Request, specifically a PKCS#10 [RFC2986] as supported by ACME.

   **FQDN**,    Fully Qualified Domain Name.

   **Requestor**, Federation Entity that requests a X.509 certificate to a CA.

   **Issuer**,  Federation Entity that serves an ACME Server. The Federation Entity is then a CA.

The terms "Federation Entity", "Trust Anchor", "Intermediate", "Entity Configuration", "Entity Statement", "Trust Mark" and "Trust Chain" used in this document are defined in the [Section 1.2](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html#name-terminology) of [OIDC-FED].

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Certificates issued using OIDC Federation

The Federation Entity Keys are used for requesting X.509 certificates.

The Issuer establishes the authorization of a Federation Entity to obtain certificates for the identifier configured in the Requestor's Entity Configuration.

The protocol assumes the following discovery preconditions are met, the Issuer MUST then have the guarranty that:

1.  The Requestor controls the private key related to the public part published in its Entity Configuration, attested by the superior Entity Statement.

2.  The Requestor controls the identifier in question, having published the Entity Configuration and having signed it using the private key related to the public one related to the CSR.

This process may be repeated to request multiple certificates related to the Federation Entity Keys and linked to a single identifier, that's the Federation Entity FQDN.

# Protocol Flow

This section presents the protocol flow. The protocol flow is subdivided in the following phases:

- **Discovery**, the Requestor obtains the available CAs within a federation.
- **Order request**, the Requestor requests a X.509 certificate to a CA.

## Discovery Preconditions

The protocol assumes the following discovery preconditions are met, where for discovery is intended the phase where a Requestor searches an Issuer to requests an X.509 certificate.

1. The Requestor and the Issuer MUST publish their Entity Configuration as defined in the [Section 6](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html#name-obtaining-federation-entity) of [OIDC-FED].
2. The Requestor and the Issuer MUST be able to establish the trust to each other obtaining the Trust Chain of each other, as defined in the [Section 3.2](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html#name-trust-chain) of [OIDC-FED].
3. The Trust Anchor and its Intermediates SHOULD implement an ACME server with at least the `newNonce` and the `newOrder` resources, as extended accordingly by this document.
4. The Issuer MUST publish in its Entity Configuration, within the metadata parameter as defined in the [Section 4](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html#name-metadata-type-identifiers) of [OIDC-FED], the metadata type `acme_provider` according to the [Metadata](#metadata) of this specification.
5. The Issuer MAY be a Leaf, in these cases a specific Trust Mark SHOULD be issued by the Trust Anchor, or on behalf of it by an allowed Trust Mark issuer as configured in the federation, and. the Trust Mark MUST then be published within the Leaf Entity Configuration.

Where the precondition number 4 and number 5 are not met, there MAY be some cases where the Requestor known a priori which are the Issuers in one or more federations, in these cases the Requestor directly requests the issuance of the X.509 certificate to the trusted Issuer.

## Overview

TBD: high level design and ascii sequence diagram.

1. The Requestor checks if its superior Federation Entity supports the ACME protocol for OpenID Connect Federation 1.0. If not, the Requestor starts the discovery process to find which are the Issuers within the federation.
2. The Requestor requests and obtains a new nonce from the Issuer, by sending a HTTP HEAD request to the Issuer's `newNonce` resource;
3. The Issuer evaluates the trust to the Requestor by checking if it is part of the federation. If not the `newNonce` request MUST be rejected (**TBD** the error to return). There are two ways the Issuer is able to check if a Requestor is part of the federation, these are listed below:
    - The Requestor adds the Trust Chain JWS header parameter related to itself, this option is RECOMMENDED since it reduces the effort of the Issuer in evaluating the trust to the Requestor;
    - The Requestor doesn't add the Trust Chain in the request, then the Issuer MUST start a [Federation Entity Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html#section-8) to obtain the Trust Chain related to the Requestor.
4. The Requestor begins the certificate issuance process by sending a HTTP POST request to the Issuer's `newOrder` resource.

Below is represented the summary of all the actions supported by the protocol defined in this document.

| Action                | Request                                | Succesful Response |

## Metadata


The Issuer MUST publish its Entity Configuration including the `acme_provider` metadata within it.

This section describe how to use the parameters defined in the [Section 7.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.1.1) of [RFC8555] in the federation Entity Configuration of the Issuer.

        "caaIdentities": ["issuer.example.com"],
        "externalAccountRequired": false
   }
}
~~~~

## newNonce request

The Requestor MUST obtain a new nonce from the Issuer, according to the [Section 7.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.2) of [RFC8555].

Below a non-normative example of the request:

~~~~ http
HEAD /acme/new-nonce HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Replay-Nonce: oFvnlFP1wIhRlYS2jTaXbA
Cache-Control: no-store
~~~~

Differences with [RFC8555]:

- The HTTP header `Link: <https://issuer.example.com/acme/directory>;rel="index"` is not required.

## newOrder request

The certificate issuance request is made by sending a HTTP POST to the Issuer `newOrder` resource, where the body of the POST is a JWS object whose JSON payload is a subset of the *ACME order object*, as defined in the [Section 7.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.4) of [RFC8555].

The *ACME order object* represents the request for a certificate issuance and is used to track the progress of that order through to issuance (see the [Section 7.1.6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.1.6) of [RFC8555] for any further information about the statuses).

~~~~ http
POST /acme/new-order HTTP/1.1

 "protected": base64url({
   "alg": "ES256",
   "kid": "1",
   "nonce": "oFvnlFP1wIhRlYS2jTaXbA",
   "url": "https://issuer.example.com/acme/new-order",
   "trust_chain": ["eyJhbGciOiJFU ...", "eyJhbGci ..."]
 }),
 "payload": base64url({
   "identifiers": [{ "type": "openid-federation", "value": "requestor.example.org" }],

   "notAfter": "2024-01-08T00:04:00+04:00"
 }),
 "signature": "H6ZXtGjTZyUnPeKn...wEA4TklBdh3e454g"
}
~~~~

## Order Object Extensions and Constraints

To the *ACME order object* properties already defined in the [Section 7.1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.1.3) of [RFC8555] are added those defined by this document and listed below, to be intended as extensions to [RFC8555].

| place             | parameter     | type              | presence | reference                 |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| protected headers | `trust_chain` | JSON Array of JWS | OPTIONAL | [OIDC-FED], Section 3.2.1 |


When OpenID Connect Federation 1.0 is used by the Issuer to attest the reliabiability of a Requestor, the following constraints to the `payload.identifiers` JSON Array MUST be respected:

- `type` MUST be set to `openid-federation`;
- `value` MUST correspond to the FQDN contained within the `iss` parameter of the Requestor's Entity Configuration. Since the Federation Entity ID is a HTTP URL, the corresponding FQDN MUST be extracted from it. For example, if the `iss` parameter withing the Entity Configuration contains the value `https://requestor.example.org/oidc/rp`, the extracted FQDN is then `requestor.example.org` and it MUST correspond to the value of the identifier contained in the order object;
- the maximum length of the JSON Array contained in the `identifiers` parameter MUST be 1, since there cannot be more than a single FQDN corresponding to a single Federation Entity. If other identifiers  are present in the request and different from the type `openid-federation`, these SHOULD be ignored.


## newOrder Response

The server MUST return an error if it cannot fulfill the request as
specified, and it MUST NOT issue a certificate with contents other
than those requested.  If the server requires the request to be
modified in a certain way, it should indicate the required changes
using an appropriate error type and description.

If the server is willing to issue the requested certificate, it
responds with a 201 (Created) response.  The body of this response is
an order object reflecting the client's request and any
authorizations the client must complete before the certificate will
be issued.

~~~~ http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Replay-Nonce: MYAuvOpaoIiywTezizk5vw
Location: https://issuer.example.com/acme/order/TOlocE8rfgo

{
 "status": "pending",
 "expires": "2016-01-05T14:09:07.99Z",

 "notBefore": "2016-01-01T00:00:00Z",
 "notAfter": "2016-01-08T00:00:00Z",

 "identifiers": [{ "type": "openid-federation", "value": "requestor.example.org" }],

 "finalize": "https://issuer.example.com/acme/order/TOlocE8rfgo/finalize"
}
~~~~

Differences with [RFC8555]:

- The HTTP Header Link is not required
- The `authorizations` arrays is not required an MUST be omitted from the order object.


## Finalize Request

Once the client believes it has fulfilled the server's requirements,
it should send a POST request to the order resource's finalize URL.
The POST body MUST include a CSR in the form of a string.

The CSR encodes the parameters for the certificate being requested [RFC2986]. The CSR is sent in the base64url-encoded version of the DER format. Please note that the value is encoded in base64url and does not include headers, then it is different from PEM.

Below a non-normative example of the `finalize` made via HTTP POST:

~~~~ http
POST /acme/order/TOlocE8rfgo/finalize HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.example.com
Content-Type: application/jose+json

{
 "protected": base64url({
   "alg": "ES256",
   "kid": "1",
   "nonce": "MYAuvOpaoIiywTezizk5vw",
   "url": "https://issuer.example.com/acme/order/TOlocE8rfgo/finalize"

 }),
 "payload": base64url({
   "csr": "MIIBPTCBxAIBADBFMQ...FS6aKdZeGsysoCo4H9P",
 }),
 "signature": "uOrUfIIk5RyQ...nw62Ay1cl6AB"
}
~~~~

The CSR encodes the client's requests with regard to the content of
the certificate to be issued.  The CSR MUST indicate the exact same
set of requested identifiers as the initial newOrder request.
Identifiers of type "dns" MUST appear either in the commonName
portion of the requested subject name or in an extensionRequest
attribute [RFC2985] requesting a subjectAltName extension, or both.

## Finalize Response

If a request to finalize an order is successful, the server will
return a 200 (OK) with an updated order object.  The status of the
order will indicate what action the client should take, these action values are defined in the [Section 7.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.4) of [RFC8555].

}
~~~~

Differences with [RFC8555]:

- The HTTP Header Link is not required

## Downloading the Certificate

The request and the response are fully compliant to the [Section 7.4.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.4.2) defined in [RFC8555].

Below a non-normative example of a request:

# Federation Identifiers Types

The "ACME Identifier Types" registry defined in the [Section 9.7.7](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-9.7.7) of [RFC8555] is extended with the types of identifiers listed below.

Template:

-  Label: The value to be put in the "type" field of the identifier object.
-  Reference: Where the identifier type is defined.

Contents:

| Label             | Reference                            |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| openid-federation | draft-demarco-acme-openid-federation |
|                   |                                      |

# Publication of the Certificates within the Federation

**TBD**, when the Issuer is the Trust Anchor or Intermediate, the X.509 certificate linked to Federation Entity Key represented in JWK in the Entity Statement related to the Requestor, SHOULD be extended with the claim `x5c`, containing the issued certificate.

# Certificate Lifecycle and Revocation

**TBD**.

The issued Certificates are related to the Federation Key attested within a Trust Chain, their expiration time MUST be equal to the expiration of the Trust Chain.

When a Federation Key is removed from the Entity Statement that attests it, and then it cannot be attested though a Trust Chain, the certificate related to it MUST be revoked by its Issuer, if not expired.

A Requestor SHOULD request the revocation of its Certificate when the related Federation Entity Key is revoked and published in the Federation Historical Key Registry.

The certficate revocation request is defined in the [Section 7.6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.6) of [RFC8555].
